 # Ball Sorter
 - <b>Description</b> you specify N = number of buckets, and an equal number of balls. Imagine all buckets a placed in a line, numbered from bucket 1 to lets say 4 (N=4). You start with all the 4 balls placed inside a single bucket (could be any one of the 4). And your destination is to distribute all the balls evenly across the buckets- so the end state is one ball per bucket. You can only move one ball from one bucket to the next in each move 
 - <b> Goal</b> the goal is to solve this in the optimal (least) number of total moves.
